    "\n",
    "A *controlled study* is one where the researcher has control over experimental variables and actively treats partipants. An *observational study* is one where the researcher observes the participants and records variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Process of Designing a Controlled Study\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Determine the *experimental unit*, the smallest unit of measurement, and the dependent variable to be measured.\n",
    "2. Determine the type of sampling to be done from the population, and the number of samples. Might require simulations to determine statistical power.\n",
    "3. Determine the experimental variables:\n",
    "    * *Background variables* are identified and measured, but cannot be controlled. They are treated as covariates. \n",
    "    * *Independent variables* are the variables of interest to the researcher.\n",
    "    * *Uncontrolled variables* cannot really be measured or controlled.\n",
