This project documents a variety of foundational topics encountered on my adventures through the world of differential geometry.

Here are the topics I'm trying to learn, in a not particularly organized way:

* Parameterized Curves
  - Tangents
  - Curvature
  - Frenet equations

* Parameterized Surfaces
  - Planes
  - Push-forwards, differentials
  - Pullbacks
  - Change of basis and Jacobians
  - Tangent planes
  - Vector fields
  - Grad, div, curl, Laplacian
  - Random walk on a sphere
  - Directional Derivatives
  - Covariant derivatives
    
* Intrinsic Geometry
  - Gauss map
  - Curvature
  - Conformal maps
  - First and second fundamental forms
  - Christoffel symbols
    
* Differential Forms
  - Boundaries
  - Integration on R^n
  - Integration on differential forms
  - Generalized Stokes Theorem

* Geodesics
  - Covariant Derivatives
